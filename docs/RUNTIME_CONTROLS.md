# Runtime controls

The Mac app exposes generation and runtime controls in its fixed right
settings pane. FP16 is the fixed KV format. Generation settings apply to the
next request; load-time settings require a reload.

## Generation controls

The Mac app and CLI expose these generation controls:

| Control | Mac values | CLI flag | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum response | Automatic | `--max-new` | App: remaining context; CLI: 1,024 tokens | The app can use the context space left after formatting the prompt. The CLI uses its explicit or default `--max-new` limit. |
| Maximum context | 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K | `--max-context` | 4K | Sets prompt plus response capacity. The app shows the FP16 KV-memory delta. |
| Temperature | 0...2 in 0.05 steps | `--temperature` | 0.2 | `0` is greedy; positive values sample. |
| Top-K | Off or 1...256 | `--top-k` | 64 | Keeps at most K candidates. CLI `0` turns it off. |
| Top-P | Off or 0.01...1 | `--top-p` | 0.95 | Applies nucleus truncation before Top-K and is effective only while Top-K is enabled. |

With positive temperature, a CLI Top-P below `1` requires Top-K between `1`
and `256`. To disable both truncation controls, pass `--top-k 0 --top-p 1`.
Generation controls apply to the next request and do not require a model
reload. They are interactive product settings, not the fixed community
benchmark protocol.

## Runtime settings

| Control | Values | Production default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expert-cache slots | 8, 16, 24, 32 | 16 | More slots can retain more routed experts and reduce later reads, but values above 16 use more RAM. |
| Prompt prefill | On, off | On | On processes known prompt tokens through the chunked prefill path. Off disables that path. |
| RDADVISE | Off, Default, Bounded, Adaptive | Off | Applies experimental read advice. Its effect depends on the workload; it may help a short decode and slow a long one. |

Changing context length, expert-cache slots, or RDADVISE requires a reload.
Some sampling changes also require a reload because greedy and sampled
generation use different output-head paths. Prompt-prefill settings apply to
each request and do not require a reload.

## Run an experiment

1. Start from 4K context, 16 expert-cache slots, prefill on, and RDADVISE off.
2. Keep the prompt and generation controls fixed.
3. Record a baseline after a warmup.
4. Change one runtime control and reload the model.
5. Compare prompt prefill, request TTFT, decode rate, peak memory, and I/O per
   token over repeated runs.
6. Restore the production defaults when the experiment ends.

Use the [community benchmark protocol](COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md) for a standard
production result. A run with changed runtime controls is experimental and must
name the changed setting.

## Read the results

- **Decode rate** measures generated tokens per second after prompt prefill.
- **Request TTFT** includes prompt prefill and the wait for the first generated
  token.
- **Peak memory** in Last run is the highest decode-service memory observed
  during the request. The HUD shows the service's current memory instead of the
  much smaller foreground UI process.
- **I/O / token** reports routed-expert read time per generated token.
- **Advanced** shows decode duration and per-token cb1, cb2, and output-head
  time. When RDADVISE runs, it also shows time, calls, data, and skipped advice.

During chunked prefill, the phase label reports exact progress, for example
`Prefill (128/514)`. Errors and unsupported configurations appear only when
they occur. RDADVISE remains experimental and is off by default. A measured
result is a data point, not a performance ceiling.

## Tool-call diagnostics

`GemmaToolCallParserError.malformed` reaches the client as a bare
`500 generation failed`, and the log line alone cannot say which of the two
sources produced it: the parser rejecting the emitted call, or a turn that
finished with `toolCalls` while no call was decoded.

Set `TFF_LOG_TOOLCALL_RAW=1` to print the diagnosis to stderr:

| Case | Output |
| --- | --- |
| Parser rejected the call | The parse error and the raw decoded text between `<<<` and `>>>`, special tokens intact (`<\|"\|>` shows as written). |
| Turn ended with no call | A single line naming the case and the visible-text length. |

The raw text is the only way to tell a model-side generation defect from a
parser gap. In one investigation it showed the model closing `edits:[{` with
`]` instead of `}` — the parser was right to reject it, and the fix belonged
in the client's tool schema, not here.

The variable is off by default: the raw text can carry file contents from tool
arguments, so it is a debugging aid, not a production setting.
